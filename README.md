# goa (Global Optimization Animations)

`goa` helps visualise the execution of some global optimisation algorithms on a given problem.

It has been developed to fulfill the assignment of Optimization Methods, a computer engineering course taught at the University of Florence.

As of now, `goa` provides implementations of the following algorithms:
 - Memetic Differential Evolution (MDE)
 - Differential Evolution (DE)
 - Coordinate Method with Simple Descent Direction (CM)

## Installation
To install `goa`, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
$ pip install goa
```

## Usage

A command-line interface is available for quick (though limited) usage, just run this in your terminal:
```bash
$ python ./src/goa/cli.py
```
For full-fledged usage, the following is an application of (MDE)[] algorithm to the (Ackley)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackley_function] function that provide also a .gif of the algorithm exectution:

```python
from gop import problems, algorithms

problem = problem.Ackley(bounds=(-2.5, 2.5))
algorithms.memetic_differential_evolution(
  problem=problem,
  local_search_algorithm=algorithms.coordinate_method,
  animation_filepath='mde-animation.gif'
)
```
